Instead, he saw it more as a place to facilitate a free flow of information exchange. He wanted to strip away the limitations from  copyright system and network restrictions and bring in a new TV culture where information can be accessed inexpensively and conveniently.  The full length of the piece ran 28 minutes and was first broadcasted in January 30, 1974 on WNET. It can be described as a visual collage made up of elements from various mediums. For example, he mixes together footage from Pepsi commercials and his own earlier works with pop music and artist contributions from people such as John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Charlotte Moorman.

1050,[18],51007,Hei tai yang: Nan Jing da tu sha,"Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre, also called Men Behind the Sun 4, is a 1994 Hong Kong film directed by Mou Tun Fei and is in many ways considered to be a follow up to the 1987 shockumentary film, Men Behind the Sun. The movie depicts the events behind the Nanking Massacre committed by the Imperial Japanese army against Chinese citizens and refugees during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Like Men Behind the Sun, the film was both criticized and praised for its brutal portrayal of the Japanese atrocities, such as the notorious contest to kill 100 people using a sword, during the early and late stages of World War II, but at the same time was questioned over historical accuracy and violence which gave the film a more exploitation feel to it.",2.982,1995-07-07,Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre,6.7,9,1995.0,7.0

Some new songs have been added to the fabulous Moose Charlap-Carolyn Leigh score (which includes ""Tender Shepherd,"" ""I Gotta Crow,"" ""I'm Flying,"" and ""I Won't Grow Up""). But the biggest asset to this production are the spectacular flying sequences: Peter even soars over the audience at times.

The play was included in the First Folio, published in 1623. Much Ado About Nothing is generally considered one of Shakespeare’s best comedies, because it combines elements of robust hilarity with more serious meditations on honor, shame, and court politics.

Not only in France but all over the world, Truffaut's Hitchcock interview developed over the years into a standard bible of film literature.

The centrepieces are the extracts from the original sound recordings of the interview with the voices of Alfred Hitchcock, Francois Truffaut, and Helen Scott – recordings which have never been heard in public before.",0.927,1999-08-05,Monsieur Truffaut Meets Mr. Hitchcock,0.0,0,1999.0,8.0

As a reporter interviews him in his beachfront home, Capote shares his ""self-regarding"" personality through hip philosophy and calculated jokes. He offers insights in an endearingly raspy voice about his latest book, 'In Cold Blood', which Capote declares to be part of a new genre, the ""non-fiction novel."" Just as the Maysles brothers' direct cinema classics turn real stories into narratives, Capote's non-fiction novel makes an effort to turn reality into art. In Cold Blood is based on first-hand accounts of an actual murder. The author affectionately discusses his coverage of the subsequent trial and his intriguing relationship with the two young killers. Capote claims it is the spontaneity of life that compels him to portray reality, but it is his own fresh energy and startling sense of humor that keep us intrigued.",0.675,1966-01-01,A Visit with Truman Capote,6.3,2,1966.0,1.0

Nearly a decade in the making, this feature documentary chronicles the action both before and after the White Stripes rose to fame and brought an international spotlight on the scene. Beginning with the hugely influential 1980s trio The Gories (and stretching back to a legacy that includes The Stooges and The MC5), the bands of the Detroit garage rock music scene are known for two things: having an impeccable knowledge of the history of rock 'n' roll and putting on a raucous live show. It Came From Detroit documents the evolution of the Detroit scene from underground obscurity to international phenomenon. We watch how, as bands such as the White Stripes, the Von Bondies and the Electric Six started to develop a following overseas, journalists and fans around the world started hyping Detroit as “The Next Seattle” -- before the whole thing nearly imploded on itself.",1.094,2009-07-23,It Came From Detroit,0.0,0,2009.0,7.0
